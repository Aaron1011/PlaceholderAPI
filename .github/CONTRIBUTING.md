To contribute to PlaceholderAPI, please follow these guidelines:

## Code formatting
Make sure your code follows the [Java Code Conventions](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconventions-150003.pdf). Most modern compilers will have an auto-formatting option, so it is best to use that.

## Compiling
Before submitting changes, make sure your code compiles + builds properly. You can use `gradle build` to compile and build your code automatically, so if the build passes you are good to go.

## Submitting a PR
To submit your changes, create a pull request with a relatively short description of your changes. If the PR is not complete, please indicate that it is a `[WIP]` pull request.
