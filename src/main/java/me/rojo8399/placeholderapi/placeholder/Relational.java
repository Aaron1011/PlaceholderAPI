/**
 * This annotation denotes a method as being relational, provided the method is
 * already a Placeholder method. Methods with this annotation are parsed with
 * "rel_[id]" instead of just the id.
 * 
 * Important: This annotation only specifies two things: That the id needs
 * "rel_" in front of it, and that it, depending on a configuration setting for
 * PlaceholderAPI, may fall back onto a non-relational placeholder of the same
 * id, using observer in favour of source.
